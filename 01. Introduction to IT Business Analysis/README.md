## Gap Analysis

A technology gap analysis is comparing current tools and technology against the desired state and then building a plan for how you will bridge the gap. A gap analysis goes beyond identifying the "what" and "when" of IT systems, infrastructure, and architecture.

**As Is – To Be Process**

- **As Is** - The as-is state of a process is the "now" state. It's how the process operates before you make any changes or improvements.
- **To Be** - The to-be process, on the other hand, is the future state. It is after you have taken on the identified action points and implemented the changes.

**Example**

| Area Under Consideration                | We investigate customer satisfaction with faulty goods returned within warranty.  |      We are not considering outside of warranty nor the satisfaction of customers at the point of sale.                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Current State                           | Desired State                                                                                                                                                                            | Action Steps                                |
| 1. Customer Satisfaction Rate = unknown | 1. Customer Satisfaction Rate = 99%                                                                                                                                                      | 1.1 Benchmark current Customer Satisfaction |
|                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1.2 Review findings                         |
| 2. Repair Time = 16 days                | 2. Repair Time = 12 days                                                                                                                                                                 | 2.1 Implement new Repair system             |
|                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2.2 Train staff to use the new system       |


## Stakeholder Management

**Stakeholder** - An **individual, group**, or **organization** who may **affect, be affected by**, or perceive itself **to be affected** by a project's decision, activity, or outcome.

- Who will use the system?
- Who will provide inputs to the system?
- Who will get the outputs of the system?
- Who has a related role?
- Who will be penalized?
- Who will be awarded?

### Stakeholder Power-Interest Grid

This matrix helps you visualize the two most important parts of a stakeholder's involvement: how much power they have over the project and how invested or interested they are in its success.

Plotting stakeholders onto that matrix groups them into four general categories of stakeholders, from those you need to manage closely to those who need to be kept in the know.

### RACI matrix

RACI is another matrix-based approach that goes deeper than the power/interest grid by considering how a stakeholder's involvement can change throughout the project.

And like the grid, it includes four categories of involvement:

- R: Responsible
  - Who is responsible for getting the work done?
  - This is the individual who executes a task, also known as the 'hands-on' individual
  - They will generally report to a manager
- A: Accountable
  - Who oversees the task?
  - This is the individual who ensures the work gets done correctly.
  - They are not hands-on but rather responsible for managing the people executing tasks and ensuring that work is completed on time and at the required quality.
- C: Consulted
  - Who needs to assist the completion of a task with additional information or support?
  - This individual is not directly responsible for a task
  - However, they do provide information that assists the person responsible for a task
  - They are generally consulted for their expertise in a specific area
 - I: Informed
  - Who needs to be updated on the progress of a task or deliverable?
  - This is generally an upper management stakeholder or potentially a client
  - They do not have immediate input on the project, but maybe the project's owner

After identifying each stakeholder in this model, you'll list each stage included in the more extensive project. Then, you'll define each stakeholder's involvement in that part.
