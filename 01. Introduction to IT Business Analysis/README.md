## Gap Analysis

A technology gap analysis is comparing current tools and technology against the desired state and then building a plan for how you will bridge the gap. A gap analysis goes beyond identifying the "what" and "when" of IT systems, infrastructure, and architecture.

**As Is â€“ To Be Process**

- **As Is** - The as-is state of a process is the "now" state. It's how the process operates before you make any changes or improvements.
- **To Be** - The to-be process, on the other hand, is the future state. It is after you have taken on the identified action points and implemented the changes.

**Example**

| Area Under Consideration                | We investigate customer satisfaction with faulty goods returned within warranty.  |      We are not considering outside of warranty nor the satisfaction of customers at the point of sale.                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Current State                           | Desired State                                                                                                                                                                            | Action Steps                                |
| 1. Customer Satisfaction Rate = unknown | 1. Customer Satisfaction Rate = 99%                                                                                                                                                      | 1.1 Benchmark current Customer Satisfaction |

|                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2.2 Train staff to use the new system       |
