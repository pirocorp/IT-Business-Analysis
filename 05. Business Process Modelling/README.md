# Business Process Modelling

## Business Process

A Business Process is an **activity or set of activities** that accomplish a **specific organizational goal**. Business Processes should have **purposeful goals**, be **as specific as possible**, and **produce consistent outcomes**.

Visual Modelling - Graphical representation using a modeling language that takes something complex and makes it easier to understand.

 - Easily understand complex information
 - Gets all stakeholders involved
 - Receive requirements efficiently
 - Identify the underlying problem
 - Analyze what-if scenarios
 - Allows removal of irrelevant information

## Business Process Model and Notation

Business Process Model and Notation is a graphical representation/mapping for specifying business processes in a business process model.

The primary goal was to develop a notation capable of mapping business processes that would be readily understandable **by all business users**, from the **business analysts** who create the initial draft of the processes to the **technical developers** responsible for implementing the technology that will perform the processes, and finally to the **business people** who will manage and monitor those processes.

- Standardization
- Process Visualization
- Save time by **eliminating unnecessary tasks**
- Process Analysis and Improvement
- Get a **clear vision** of exactly how everything in your business works
- Collaboration and Documentation
- Reduce the rate at which your employees **forget, overlook, or wrongly execute work**

### BPMN Swimlanes

**Pools** represent **different organizations or entirely separate processes**.

**Lanes** represent **different teams or individuals** within the same organization.

Example: If we were to map a **Customer Support process**, there would be one pool representing **the Business** and one representing **the Customer**.


### Flow Objects - Activities

### Flow Objects – Gateways

A **Gateway** acts as a **decision point** that decides which (outgoing) decision to take based on **evaluating the situation**.
