# SDLC Methodologies

## Spiral Methodology

In the **Spiral Model**, the software development process is represented as a spiral, with **each loop** of the spiral representing a **phase in the development lifecycle**. It is Risk Driven as it provides **support for Risk Handling**. 

 - Combination of linear and iterative
 - Focuses heavily on Risk Assessment
 - Minimized risk by breaking a project into smaller segments
 - Each cycle begins with identifying stakeholders and what success looks like
 - Each cycle ends with a review and a commitment
