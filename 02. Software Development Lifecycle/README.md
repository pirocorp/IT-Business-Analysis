## Stages and Processes

Software development processes can be divided into tasks that can be **assigned, completed, and measured** following the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** - a cost-effective and time-efficient methodology consisting of six stages

# SDLC Methodologies

## Spiral Methodology

In the **Spiral Model**, the software development process is represented as a spiral, with **each loop** of the spiral representing a **phase in the development lifecycle**. It is Risk Driven as it provides **support for Risk Handling**. 

 - Combination of **linear and iterative**
 - Focuses heavily on **Risk Assessment**
 - Minimized risk by breaking a project into **smaller segments**
 - Each cycle **begins** with **identifying stakeholders and what success looks like**
 - Each cycle **ends** with **a review and a commitment**

### Pros and Cons

| Advantages                                                    | Disadvantages                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accurately manages and mitigates risks                        | Long time to get to finished product                                             |
| Issues are identified and solved early                        | High cost and Long Time                                                          |
| Estimates near the end of the project are very accurate       | The success of the Spiral Model relies heavily on accurate risk analysis         |
| Early involvement from developers increases successful design | Very customized solution limits reusability                                      |
| Supports the development of prototypes early in the process.  | More complex to manage compared to linear methodologies like the Waterfall Model |

### When to Use?

- Risk identification and mitigation are extremely important 
- Medium to High-risk projects
- Users are unsure of their needs
- Prototypes are needed
- Requirements are complex
- Time and cost are not as important
- Little to no experience in projectâ€™s area


## DevOps Methodology

**DevOps** is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to **improve collaboration, communication**, and **integration** between **development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)** teams in the software development and deployment process.

- Automates repetitive tasks, such as build, testing, deployment, and monitoring
- Streamlines the development and delivery process
- Emphasizes Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- Continuous monitoring and feedback of applications and infrastructure

### Pros and Cons

| Advantages                                                                                      | Disadvantages                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enables rapid and frequent software releases                                                    | May require significant initial effort, especially in organizations with traditional development and operations silos |
| Fosters better communication and collaboration between development, operations, and other teams | Could increase complexity in the development pipeline                                                                 |
| Automation reduces the risk of human errors, making deployments more reliable and consistent    | Maintaining and updating automation scripts and tools                                                                 |
| Enables organizations to scale their software development and deployment processes efficiently  | Cultural shift                                                                                                        |

### When to Use?
- If the organization needs to release software updates or new features frequently
- When you have multiple teams working on a project, such as development, testing, operations, and security
- DevOps complements cloud-based architectures and microservices
- If the development process involves many repetitive tasks
- Enables organizations to scale their software development and deployment processes efficiently
