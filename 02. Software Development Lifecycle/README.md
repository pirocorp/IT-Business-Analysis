## Stages and Processes

Software development processes can be divided into tasks that can be **assigned, completed, and measured** following the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** - a cost-effective and time-efficient methodology consisting of six stages

# SDLC Methodologies

## Spiral Methodology

In the **Spiral Model**, the software development process is represented as a spiral, with **each loop** of the spiral representing a **phase in the development lifecycle**. It is Risk Driven as it provides **support for Risk Handling**. 

 - Combination of **linear and iterative**
 - Focuses heavily on **Risk Assessment**
 - Minimized risk by breaking a project into **smaller segments**
 - Each cycle **begins** with **identifying stakeholders and what success looks like**
 - Each cycle **ends** with **a review and a commitment**

### Pros and Cons
| Advantages                                                    | Disadvantages                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accurately manages and mitigates risks                        | Long time to get to finished product                                             |
| Issues are identified and solved early                        | High cost and Long Time                                                          |
| Estimates near the end of the project are very accurate       | The success of the Spiral Model relies heavily on accurate risk analysis         |
| Early involvement from developers increases successful design | Very customized solution limits reusability                                      |
| Supports the development of prototypes early in the process.  | More complex to manage compared to linear methodologies like the Waterfall Model |

### When to Use?

- Risk identification and mitigation are extremely important 
- Medium to High-risk projects
- Users are unsure of their needs
- Prototypes are needed
- Requirements are complex
- Time and cost are not as important
- Little to no experience in projectâ€™s area
